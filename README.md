# NUMERICAL METHODS SIMULATOR

Overview
 - This Numerical Method Simulator is a JavaFX application developed in NetBeans that enables users to perform calculations using the False Position and Bisection methods. The simulator provides an interactive interface for inputting function equations, specifying initial guesses, and setting convergence criteria. It then displays step-by-step calculations and graphical representations of the methods' iterations to facilitate understanding and analysis.

## Features
 - Bisection Method: The simulator also includes the Bisection method, another numerical technique for root finding. It operates by repeatedly halving the interval containing the root until the desired precision is achieved.
 - False Position Method: The simulator implements the False Position method for finding roots of continuous functions within a specified interval. It iteratively refines the root approximation until reaching the desired level of accuracy.
 - Interactive Interface: Users can input function equations, initial guesses, and convergence criteria via a user-friendly graphical interface.
 - Iteration Calculation: The simulator provides detailed iteration calculations, displaying the current interval, function values, and root approximations at each iteration.
 - Error Message: The application does not accept letters in the text field wherein shows error message when letters are inputted or even when some values are missing.
